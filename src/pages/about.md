# About Us

We're a software company with experience in Reason / OCaml, Javascript
and Python, employing them in Blockchains, Web Applications and Compilers. We're
experts in Reason/OCaml and Javascript tools and leverage this
knowledge to drive safe and productive developer experience.

## Thoughts and Work

Here are some essays we wrote so that you get a sneak peek into our
thought process.

1. Full Stack React with a Natively compiled Server that doesn't need
   Node.js.
2. Improving the productivity of Reason/OCaml development on Windows.
3. Cohesive OCaml-Javascript-C/C++ experience with
   [esy](https://esy.sh) package manager.
4. Debuggability of OCaml applications.
5. Observability and profiling OCaml applications.

We're a open source company, which is to say we directly participate
in open source development, giving us deep understanding of the
tech-stack, helping us develop memory safe software.

### Mobile and Web Apps

We develop interactive mobile and Web apps leveraging open source tech
focusing on security and fast development iterations.

### Infrastructure and scaling solutions

Have a PoC that needs to scale? We specialise in system design and
automated infrastructure management solutions with Kubernetes and
Terraform.

### Performance engineering

Is your Javascript or Python stack running slowly? We specialise in
inspection of runtime internals of these two languages (along with
OCaml) to help us analyse and help you fix your performance problems.

### Tezos Blockchain and smart contract compilers

We worked on the Tezos blockchain to deliver the following.

#### `CHECK_TX` instruction in Michelson Interpreter

We implemented `CHECK_TX` proposal for the michelson interpreter.

#### Multi-platform builds for Ligo smart contract compiler

We helped the Ligo team setup CI infrastructure to build the ligo compiler on multiple platforms

#### Package management for Ligo smart contract compiler

We helped the Ligo team setup package management.

### OCaml project based training

We offer guided project based training to get up-and-running with Reason/OCaml

### OCaml internals deep understanding

We participate in community meetings where everyone shares notes and
implementation of experimental ideas in the area of compiler and
tooling.
